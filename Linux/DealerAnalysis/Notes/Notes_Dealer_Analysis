********
Instead of writing multiple scripts to get the following information, I wanted to simply write one script:
- find_dealers_for_losses.sh

I used a file that contained the date/times for the losses that I compiled in the Player Analysis section.
You'll find more information on the script in the documentation in the script.

Primary dealer worked during most losses: Billy Jones

They worked during all 13 of the major losses.
(Got the above with the "cat Dealers_working_during_losses | grep 'Billy Jones' | wc -l" command)
