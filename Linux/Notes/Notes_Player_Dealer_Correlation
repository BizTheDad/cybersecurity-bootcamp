The player and dealer that are colluding together are Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones respectively.

From the Player Analysis, Mylie Schmidt was playing during all major losses.

From the Dealer Analysis, Billy Jones was dealing during almost all major losses.

Scripts Information:
- The assignment asked us to write multiple scripts to get dealers that worked during losses. Instead I simply wrote one script -- "find_dealers_for_losses.sh".
- The "find_dealers_for_date_and_time.sh" is the main workhorse script that the find dealers scripts will use. It will format check the date and time inputs. I did this even though it wasn't required to practice regular expresssions.
